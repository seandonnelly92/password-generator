_This project was created for module 5 of the EdX Skills for Life Front End Development bootcamp. In this challenge, we were tasked with creating a password generator._


# Password Generator

## Description

This simple password generator lets you choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters long and which character types should be included out of special characters, numbers, lower case and upper case characters. It does this by putting all of the potential characters into an array, then looping through generating random selections from this array of characters and adding as many as your chosen password length to the generated password. 

**Here is the published website URL:** https://seandonnelly92.github.io/password-generator/
